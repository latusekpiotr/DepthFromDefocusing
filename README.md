# DepthFromDefocusing
Deph data acquisition using the defocusing method (Matlab)

The Matlab code in this repository takes two pictures of the same object as an input (here called PICT0002.TIF and PICT0003.TIF) and creates a 3D visualization of the object based on that (here called result.JPG).

This is the implementation of the algorithm described in the "Depth from Defocusing" paper by Akihiro Horii of the Computational Vision and Active Perception Laboratory (CVAP), Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden.
